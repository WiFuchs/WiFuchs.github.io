I've been playing acoustic guitar for years, but after playing my buddy's Les Paul, I decided I wanted an electric too. My roomate and I decided build our dream guitars. This design is based off of Bruce Springsteen's Telecaster. Unfortunately, I lost a lot of the build photos when my phone broke, so this will be a bit sparse...

### Materials
Were ballin on a budget, (and I want to prove to my friend that you can make a guitar out of anything), so I'm using hardware store Poplar boards. Poplar is notoriously off-putting in color, but I [found a guy who makes it look beautiful](https://monkwoodstudio.com/), and he was kind enough to share his method with me.
I decided to buy a fully formed neck, because I shaped and fretted one in my bass ukulele project and oh man that was an ordeal... I bought the potentiometers, switches and wires as a kit with a wiring schema for a telecaster online.
After watching my friend spend $150 on pickups, I decided to try my hand at winding them myself. This was by far the most frustrating part of the build...

### Build
The build took the greater part of Spring quarter, mostly because I only had a free hour or two to build each week between track and Systems Programming... Still, it turned out in the end!

First things first, I cut my boards down, stacked them and glued them face to face to create a giant block. The board had a streak of green heartwood, so I stacked them in to form a pattern. I actually tried several different patterns, but I liked the one below the best. Then, I planed this block down to thickness and made sure that it was flat. I drew the guitar shape on it and cut it out *roughly* on a bandsaw. Then, I cut a precise template out of MDF, attached it to my blank, and used a router table with a 1/2" straight bit to take the blank down to the exact profile of the template. If I could go back, I would have spent more time getting the template *EXACTLY* how I wanted it, to save time sanding later. Next, I routed out the body cavities for my pickups and controls.

After the body was prepared, I set out to wind my pickups. I knew nothing about pickups before this, but after some research I decided that I wanted one 7k ohm and one 5k ohm pickup. With the copper wire that I used, this was about 6000-9000 winds. I absolutely did not want to do this completely by hand, so I rigged up a drill to spin the bobbin and ran the wire through a clamp to limit the traverse and keep it on the bobbin. Winding the first pickup took about an hour, because the wire kept breaking and I was too scared to go fast with the drill. Since I broke so much wire, I actaully ran out and had to order more. The second pickup, on the other hand, took only 10 minutes. The pickup winding station is pictured below.

Soldiering the pickups was a whole other thing... The wire is insulated and thinner than the average human hair, which made getting clean connections a pain. However, after several tries and some delicate unwinding, I was able to get two functioning pickups!

Since we had access to the laser cutter, we just had to sign our guitars. I wrote "Poly telecaster" on mine, and engraved the jumping fox from the pizza peel onto the back, where it attaches to the body.

At this point, all I had left to do was put it all together! That took a few hours, but, later that day I was able to plug in and play, and oh boy... All I can say is my neighbors next year are gonna have complaints...
